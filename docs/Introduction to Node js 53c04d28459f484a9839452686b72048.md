## What is Node js

Node.js is a runtime for JavaScript built on top of Chrome’s V8. It allows you to develop apps in JavaScript outside of the browser. It’s single threaded non blocking and asynchronous. This is acheived by the use of an event loop at the core of Node.js

### Use cases

Because Node.js con run outside of the browser, it can be used for pretty much anything.

- API’s and servers
- Databases
- CLI’s
- Automation's
- Basic Scripting
- GPU shopping bots

## Basics Components

### Globals

• `global` Think of this as like `window` but for Node.js. **DON'T ABUSE IT**!

• `__dirname` This global is a `String` value that points the the directory name of the file it's used in.

• `__filename` Like `__dirname`, it too is relative to the file it's written in. A `String` value that points the the file name.

• `process` A swiss army knife global. An `Object` that contains all the context you need about the current program being executed. Things from env vars, to what machine you're on.

• `exports` `module` `require` These globals are used for creating and exposing modules throughout your app. We'll get to modules in a second

Depending on what version on Node.js you’re running, there are so many more globals.

### Modules

There is no GUI in Node.js. This also means there aren’t any script tags to include JS files into our application. Node.js uses modules to share your JavaScript in your apps. No window or globals needed. If you’ve ver done [window.App](http://window.App) = window.App || {} then you’ll like this!

### What is a module

A module is a reusable chunk of code that has its own context. That way modules can’t interfere with or polute the global scope.

You can think of them like lego blocks that you can create, import, and share.

### Two module types

By default, Node.js uses common js modules. With newer versions of Node.js we can now take advantage of ES6 modules. To opt using this syntax, you can use the .mjs extension of .js. We’ll be using the ES6 module syntax going forward as they are the standard now with browsers adding support now.

### Module syntax

---

Now, let’s create our first module. The only thing we have to do is expose some code in one for our JavaScript files. We can do that with the **export** keyword

```
// utils.js
export const action = () => {

}

export const run = () => {

}

```

```
// app.js

import { action, run } from './utils'
```

Usually if you only have to expose one bit of code, you should use the default keyword. This allows you to import the module with whatever name you want.

### Internal Modules

---

Node.js comes with some great internal modules. You can think of them as like the phenomenal global APIs in the browser. Here are some of the most useful ones:

• `fs` - useful for interacting with the file system.

• `path` - lib to assit with manipulating file paths and all their nuiances.

• `child_process` - spawn subprocesses in the background.

• `http` - interact with OS level networking. Useful for creating servers.

### File System

Until Node.js, there wasn’t a great way to access the file system on a machine with JavaScript this is due to security restrictions in most browsers

### Reading a file

---

Node.js ships with a powerful module, fs short for file system. There are many methods on the fs module. To read a file, we’ll use the readFile method.

```
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></head><body><h1>{title}</h1><p>{body}</p></body></html>
```

```jsx
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";

let template = await readFile(new URL("./test.html", import.meta.url), "utf-8");

const data = {
  title: "My new file",
  body: "I wrote this file to disk using node",
};

for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(data)) {
  template = template.replace(`{${key}}`, val);
}

await writeFile(new URL("./index.html", import.meta.url), template);
```

## Error Handling

The last thing you want is your entire server crashing because of an error, or, is that exactly what you want? Regardless, you should have the choice. So you better handle those errors. Depending on the type of code Node allows us to handle our errors how we see fit.

### Process exiting

---

When a exception is thrown in Node.js. the current process will exit wit ha code of 1.

This effectively errors our and stops your programming completely. You can manually do this with:

`process.exit(1)`

### Async Errors

---

When dealing with callbacks that are used for async operations, the standard pattern is:

```
fs.readFile(filePath, (error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    // do something
  } else {
    // yaaay
  }
})
```

Callback accept the (error , result) argument signature where error could be null if there is no error.

For promises, you can continue to use the .catch() pattern. Nothing new to see here.

For async / await you should use try / catch.

```
try {
  const result = await asyncAction()
} catch (e) {
  // handle error
}
```

### Sync Errors

---

For sync errors, try/ctach works just fine, just like with async await.

```
try {
  const result = syncAction()
} catch (e) {
  // handle error
}
```

### Catch All

---

Finally, if you just can’t catch those pesky errors for any reason. Maybe some lib is throwing them and you can’t catch them. You can use:

`process.on('uncaughtException', cb)`

## Packages

The most beautiful part about Node.js is not the JavaScript, it’s the thriving community. There are millions of node projects ready to be installed and consumed by your application. These projects are called packages

### NPM

---

**Init**

To consume a package, we must first turn our app into a package. We can do this with a simple file called package.json on the root of our app. Writing by hand is cool, but using CLI called npm is better. NPM was already installed when you installed Node.js. In a new folder, run npm init.

This will initialize a new package by walking you through a few prompts.

```
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Now are soon to be app is a package. We’ll get into how to distribute and deploy different types of Node.js apps, but for now, this package is staying local. Let’s take a look at some of these fields:

• `"name"` - is the name of your package. Can be anything since we're local

• `"version"` - is the [**Semantic Version Number**](https://semver.org/) or semver

• `"main"` - the main entry point into your package

• `"scripts"` - object of custom scripts to be executed with `npm` cli

**Commands**

NPM has several commands at its disposal that you don’t need to know really. There are some important ones that you will use repeatedly.

• `npm install` - installs given module(s) from remote registries or local sources

• `npm test` - runs the `test` script in your package.json

• `npm uninstall` - will uninstall a give package

No matter what company you’re at or the app, you’ll work with these three commands all the time. Unless you’re one of the crazies that don’t write tests. The rest of the commands will be unique to your app.

### Finding and installing packages

---

Most modules are hosted on a registry somewhere. The biggest and most used one is, the NPM registry. They don’t stand alone though. Github also allows devs to publish packages to their registry. And there are many others.

A good flow to find a package you need that you don’t already know by name yet, is to go the npm site or Google and search for what you need. Say you need a lib to convert html to PDF’s, NPM will give you back a list of packages.

Once you know the package(s) you want to install, you can do so with:

`npm install package1 package2 package3 --save`

You can install as many packages with one command as you like. The —save flag is to let NPM know to update the package.json’s dependency field with all of these packages. We need this because we don’t want to check in the downloaded packages into source code for many reason.

You’ll also notice a new folder on your project’s root named node_modules. This is where NPM will install your packages. You should never have to touch this folder. But if you take a peek, you’ll see more than the packages you installed. That’s because those packages needed other packages, and so on and so on

## CLIs

A CLI, or command line interface is a program designed to start and complete one off tasks. Like git or npm. Node.js is a perfect runtime to create a CLI that will run on any machine that has Node.js installed.

### Creating a CLI

---

Creating a CLI in Node.js just takes a extra step or two because they are really just an ordinary Node.js app wrapped behind a bin command. For this exercise, we’ll create a CLI that opens a random reddit post in our browser. To start, we’ll create a new folder and make it package with npm init.

Once inside that folder, create a file reddit.mjs

```
// reddit.mjs
#! /usr/bin/env node

console.log('hello from your CLI')
```

The first line on that file is called a shabang or hashbang. It’s needed to tell the machine where the interpreter is located that is needed to execute this file. For us, that will be Node.js.

Next we need to tell Node.js what the name of our CLI is so when can actually use it in out terminal. Just have to add a section to our package.json:

```
"bin": {
  "reddit": "./reddit.mjs"
}

```

Once installed, this package will have it’s bin command installed into your machine’s bin folder allowing us to use the reddit command.

Lastly, we must install our own package locally so we can test out the CLI. We could just execute the file with the node runtime, bet we want to see the CLI actually work.

`npm install -g`

We can simply install with no args which tells npm to install the current directory. The -g flag means we want to globally install this package vs in a local node_modules.

You should now be able to run reddit and see your log print.

### Packages in our Package

---

Now to realize our dream of our reddit CLI opening a random reddit post, we have some work to do. Luckily for us, we can use NPM to install some packages to help

`npm install open node-fetch yargs --save`

We’ll install just these three packages.

• `open` - will open our browser with a URL

• `node-fetch` - is a fetch client that we can use to hit the reddit API

• `yargs` - will allow us to process any flags or arguments passed to the CLI

So to put it all together

```
#! /usr/bin/env node
// import our packages
import open from 'open'
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
import yargs from 'yargs'

// parse env vars
const { argv } = yargs(process.argv)
// init fetch to reddit api
const res = await fetch('https://www.reddit.com/.json')
const data = await res.json()
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * data.data.children.length)
// get radom post from reddit api response of all posts on front page
const post = data.data.children[randomIndex]

// log if --print flag is passed
if (argv.print) {
  console.log(`
    Title: ${post.data.title}\n
    Link: ${post.data.permalink}
  `)
} else {
  // open in browser if not
  open(`https://reddit.com${post.data.permalink}`)
}
```

## Servers

Node.js has access to OS level functionality, like networking tools. This allows us to build very capable server. Mixed with the fact that Node.js is single threaded an runs an even loop for async tasks, Node.js is widely used for API’s that need to respond fast and don’t require heavy CPU intensive work.

### The hard way

---

Node.js ships with the http module. This module is an abstraction around OS level networking tools. For Node.js, the http module would be considered “low level”. Let’s create a simple server

```
import http from 'http'

const host = 'localhost'
const port = 8000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    let body = ''

    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk.toString()
    })

    req.on('end', () => {
      if (req.headers['content-type'] === 'application/json') {
        body = JSON.parse(body)
      }

      console.log(body)
      res.writeHead(201)
      res.end('ok')
    })
  } else {
    res.writeHead(200)
    res.end('hello from my server')
  }

})

server.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://${host}:${port}`)
})
```

Using the createServer method on the http module, we create a server. Before we start the server, we need to make sure it can handle incoming requests. That’s the callback inside of createServer. Next is starting the server. To do that, we need a port and a host. Sites default to port 8080 or 8000 so it’s not uncommon to use that wen developing locally. The host is going to be your machine, which is [localhost](http://localhost) or 127.0.0.1.

Using the http module is fine for this small example, but for building real world APIs we should utilize the community and install some packages to help up with this task.

### Express

---

There is an awesome packaged, express, that makes creating servers in Node.js a breeze. We’re going to use it now.

`npm install express body-parser morgan`

• `express` - a framework for building servers

• `body-parser` - a middleware that parses incoming requests

• `morgan` = a middleware for logging incoming requests

With everything installed, we’ll create a simple API for todo app using express.

```
import express from 'express'
import morgan from 'morgan'
import bp from 'body-parser'

const { urlencoded, json } = bp

const db = {
  todos: [],
}

const app = express()

app.use(urlencoded({ extended: true }))
app.use(json())
app.use(morgan('dev'))

app.get('/todo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ data: db.todos })
})

app.post('/todo', (req, res) => {
  const newTodo = { complete: false, id: Date.now(), text: req.body.text }
  db.todos.push(newTodo)

  res.json({ data: newTodo })
})

app.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('Server on http://localhost:8000')
})
```

Compared to the native http module, express feels like cheating.

Our todo API has two routes:

• `GET /todo` - get all todos

• `POST /todo` - create a new todo

Express has a healthy community with tons of plugins and middleware to help you build our API’s. I have a course or two showing you how! Check those our to really learn how to get the best of Express

## Testing

One of the most common usecases for Node.js is writing test for Node.js and Frontend apps. Because Node.js can run outside the browser, it’s perfect for CI environments and testing automations.

### Basic unit tests

---

Unit test will test little chunks of your code in isolation to ensure they behave has intended. Node.js ships with the assert module. This module gives us so many utilities that allows us to create expectations of on our code. When those expectations aren’t met, assert will throw an error telling us why. This is perfect for testing!.

First let’s create some code to test:

```
// myLib.mjs
export const add = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2

```

Next let’s write some assertions on this code

```
/ test.mjs
import assert from 'assert'
import { add } from './myLib.mjs'

try {
  console.log('add() should add two numbers ')
  assert.strictEqual(add(2, 5), 7)
  console.log('  ✅ passed')
} catch (e) {
  console.log('  🚫 fail')
  console.error(e)
}
```

Now run the test file with:

`node test.mjs`

You should get an output that describes how this assertion fails. Because our add function actually multiplies two numbers and instead of adding them. So either our tests is off or the code is wrong. Let’s say the code is wrong, so lets fix that and run the test again and we should see that it passes now.

Assert is great but there are some amazing tools and libs built around it that make writing and reading tests satisfying. One of those tools that the community has adopted is called jest.

### Using Jest

---

Jest is a testing lib created by Facebook. Its a wonderful testing lib for any situation. Let’s give it a try! Create a new package with npm and install jest

`npm install jest --save-dev`

Notice we used the —save-dev flag this time. We want to save jest in out package.json but as a dev dependency. Because our code does not depend on jest at runtime to execute. When your app gets deployed or installed by another dev, those machines will only NEED to install dependencies and not dev dependency. Saving space and time.

Next add a test script in the package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Now we need some code to test.

```jsx
// myLib.mjs

const delay = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
const users = [
  { email: "goku@test.com", id: 1, name: "Goku", verified: false },
];

const getNewUser = async (id) => {
  await delay(100);
  const user = users.find((u) => u.id === id);

  if (!user) throw new Error("User does not exist");
  return user;
};

const mapObjectToArray = (o, cb) => {
  const results = [];

  for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(o)) {
    results.push(cb(k, v, o));
  }

  return results;
};

module.exports = { getNewUser, mapObjectToArray };
```

At this time, the latest version of jest lacks support for ES modules without some setup, we’re using coomonjs modules. The next version of Jest will support these though. We have some async code and a function with a callback. These would’ve been tedious to test with just assert alone. Jest makes this easy

```jsx
// myLib.mjs

// lib.spec.js
const { mapObjectToArray, getNewUser } = require("./myLib");

describe("getNewUser", () => {
  test("user does exist", async () => {
    const user = await getNewUser(1);

    expect(user).toBeTruthy();
    expect(user.verified).toBe(false);
  });

  test("user does not exist", async () => {
    expect.assertions(1);

    try {
      await getNewUser(3);
    } catch (e) {
      expect(e.message).toBe("User does not exist");
    }
  });
});

describe("mapObjectToArray", () => {
  test("callback gets called for each value", () => {
    const mock = jest.fn();

    mapObjectToArray({ a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 }, mock);
    expect(mock.mock.calls.length).toBe(3);
  });

  test("callback gets the right args", () => {
    const mockCb = jest.fn();
    const o = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 };

    mapObjectToArray(o, mockCb);
    const firstCall = mockCb.mock.calls[0];

    expect(firstCall[0]).toBe("a");
    expect(firstCall[1]).toBe(1);
    expect(firstCall[2]).toBe(o);
  });
});
```

Notice how we didn’t have to require or import a jest module but yet we have access to all these new globals like describe and test. That’s because this test file will be executed with the jest cli which will supply these values during runtime. If you executed this file with the node runtime, you’ll get errors.

Most Node.js testing frameworks follow this format of describing a test suite, usually a function. From there, we make different calls to test for each assertion we want to claim on that code. Sometimes, you might make many assertions in one test call. There is no one right way.

Now, let’s run the test. Jest will look for any file with the extension and run it.

## Deployment

Now that you can develop with Node.js, you need to learn how to get your apps off your local machine and into the world. Depending on what your app does will determine how you deploy it.

### Packages

---

For CLI’s, Libraries, Plugins, etc, you would publish these to NPM so other devs can install it. The NPM CLI makes this easy. Let’s take our CLI that we created and publish it.

First thing is to make sure you have a unique package name in the name field of package.json. NPM will let you know when you try to publish. Next, create a NPM account. Once you’ve done that, you need to login to NPM from your terminal with

`npm login`

We’re ready to publish. Just run:

`npm publish`

And that’s it. Your CLI can now be installed with `npm install [name]`

### Servers

For API’s and background tasks that operation on API’s or databases, you’d deploy these to a hosting provider like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud, etc. Let’s deploy our Server! We’ll be using Heroku for this as its really easy to deploy an app.

First create a heroku account and then install the cli. Next, we have to tell heroku how to start our app. We can add a start script in our package.json. We also have to tell heroku what version of Node.js we want to use.

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./path/to/server.mjs"
},

"engines": {
  "node": "14.x"
}
```

We have to change a few things to ensure or Server won’t crash when deployed. Right now we have a hard coded port, we need to change that to an environment variable that Heroku will inject at runtime. We can use process.env.PORT. Lastly, make sure we’re not checking in the node_modules folder into git by adding it to the .gitignore file. If you don’t have one, then create one and this

```
/node_modules
npm-debug.log
.DS_Store
/*.env
```

These are just some common files and folders that we don’t want tracked in git. We’ll be deploying to heroku with git, so we don’t want these files in heroku either. Commit your changes to git, and then login to the heroku CLI

`heroku login`

Next, create new heroku app:

`heroku create`

Finally, push our server to heroku via git

`git push heroku main`
